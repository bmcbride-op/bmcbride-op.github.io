Today dawns with a quiet weight for me, a milestone _20 years_ in the crafting. On March 11, 2005, I plunged into a journey that reshaped how I live and breathe video games. That was the day the haunting streets of City 17 unfolded before me in Half-Life 2, a game that still claims a top spot in my heart. The oppressive air, the gravity gun’s hum, the visuals and story that somehow hold up—it gripped me tight and never let go. Yet, as much as I could linger on Half-Life 2’s brilliance, that’s not what I’m here to honor. It’s Steam, the unassuming companion that tagged along. Back in 2005, Steam was no titan—just a scrappy little gatekeeper, ensuring your big-box PC game was legit and slipping Valve patches through without forcing you to trawl the internet’s shadier corners.

I stepped into Steam that year and soon picked up one of its earliest oddities—a quirky indie called Rag Doll Kung Fu, with its floppy physics and goofy martial arts charm. Back then, Steam’s purpose was lean: deliver updates, check your key, call it a day. No sprawling digital shelves, no wishlists taunting me with games I’ll never play. Looking back across two decades, it’s staggering how that humble spark ignited something visionary—a platform that didn’t just shift PC gaming but rewrote the rules of the industry.

Steam hasn’t merely grown; it’s become a beacon, a rare defender of gamers and developers in a world too often tangled in corporate greed. I’ve watched hulking companies charge in, wallets open, promises loud, caring more for profit margins than the players or the creators who fuel this art. Over 20 years, I’ve seen a trail of Steam challengers—EA, Ubisoft, Epic, Amazon—rise and falter, while GOG offers something unique, whispering greatness through game preservation. But the rest? They miss the pulse: Steam’s built for gamers, by gamers. It’s not a sterile money trap; it’s a love letter to the craft, penned by people who dream of a better industry.

I cherish my Nintendo and older PlayStation consoles—few things rival a Mario Kart night with the kids, a trek through Hyrule’s wilds, the Mushroom Kingdom or sneaky along as Solid Snake. But as I’ve grown, in years and as a gamer, the cracks have sharpened into view. They preach “for the players,” yet I stumble over locked gardens, inflated prices, and policies that feel like a slow drip of coins from my pocket. Steam’s not without flaws, but it pulses with soul. So, on this quiet 20-year mark—since I first clicked “install” on my clunky Dell E501—I’m pausing to reflect on what Steam means, not just to PC gaming, but to the sprawling tapestry of this industry. It’s one of the last strongholds still swinging for us.

Years back, I rambled to my then-uninterested girlfriend—now my wife—about how Valve topped my list of gaming heroes. Two decades on, that truth still echoes. They’ve got this knack for nailing it, even if they dawdle along the way. Once, I’d have hoisted Blizzard up beside them—two titans of my youth. But Blizzard’s tumble stings, from worlds I’d vanish into to a mess of missteps that broke gamers’ trust, mine included. Valve stands firm. They don’t flood us with releases like Nintendo, PlayStation, or Blizzard once did, but when they unveil something—Half-Life: Alyx, Portal 2, Counter-Strike 2—it’s a thunderbolt. The industry holds its breath, because Valve doesn’t just craft games; they forge moments.

I’m eager for Steam’s next 20 years—the twists, the bold leaps, the storms it’ll weather. It’s been a wild ride, and I’ve got a feeling the brightest chapters lie ahead.

Full Steam ahead.
